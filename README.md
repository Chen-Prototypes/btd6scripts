### BTD 6 Script

This script should be able to beat most maps on all difficulty settings except for CHIMPS. It requires that you use Cheat Engine to freeze your gold setting so you can't lose ingame cash. You also need to play in 1920 by 1080 resolution and keep the game in focus on your window.

The beginning of this project was quite fun, writing the overarching functions and adding to them, but by now since most of the code is finished its been quite tedious given that most of my time working on this has been waiting for bugs and making the minor adjustments to fix them.

It doesn't completely work yet, but it does for the most part. The code is simple enough to understand and modify, so fixing bugs shouldnt be too hard.
